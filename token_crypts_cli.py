Token Crypts - Level 1: The Token Crypts

Learn about LLM tokenization through an interactive dungeon adventure!

This level teaches:
- How tokens work (words split into subword pieces)
- How to use Ollama sidekicks (pull, run, remove)
- That LLMs understand meaning, not just spelling
- Why keyword filters can't stop true AI understanding

Run with --simulated flag to play without Ollama installed.
